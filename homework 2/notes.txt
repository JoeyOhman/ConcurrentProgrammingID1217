Like homework 1, the matrixsum achieves speedup with 2,3 and 4 threads. 
While Quicksort only achieves with 2 threads (stays constant with 3 or 4).

I am guessing that since the matrix task requires more memory, it will also have to read more memory.
This will lead to threads waiting for memory reads, and will then be able to utilize hyperthreading. 
(Letting another thread execute while waiting)

Quicksort however, requires less memory and will have a sequential partion before any parallel execution begins.
The memory used by the largest data I used when sorting (1.000.000) integers. 4 MB, is about the same size as
my largest cache. Therefore I am guessing that the threads in quicksort do not have to wait very long for 
memory reads and cannot utilize hyperthreading very much. 



Question: Huge overhead using Open MP? Not worth it if not great amount of data?
