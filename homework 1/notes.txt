Quicksort achieves speedup with 2 threads. More than 2 threads do not affect the execution time.

MatrixSumA achieves speedup with 2, 3 and 4 threads. More than 4 threads to not affect execution time.
1 thread: 0.59 sec
2 threads: 0.41 sec
3 threads: 0.33 sec
4 threads: 0.30 sec
threads > 4: 0.30 sec
Is this because of 4 hardware threads? Why do QS only improve with 2 threads and not 4? (2 cores)

MatrixSumB follows the same performance pattern as in A

MatrixSumC follows the same performance pattern as in A and B
